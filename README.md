## Machine Learning with Iris Dataset.

Check out the app:  https://sarthakdasadia.shinyapps.io/iris/

The app reads iris data set and makes exploratory plots according to user's input. The sidebar panel shows X & Y axis options for this plot.

For example, the app currently uses two ML methods: Random Forest and Decision Tree. Users can pick a method and training sample size*. The results are displayed by this app. The app also displays which data points were correctly predicted by the method.

* The sample size option let user pick the training sample fraction in %. For example, Sample Size of 0.6 indicates that the training sample is 60% and test sample is 40%.
